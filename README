MetaCode/Reader version 0.01
============================

Perl module for translating Xerox's binary data format printer file format
into a human readable format.

The Xerox Metacode format is fed directly to Xerox Enterprise Printing
Systems (EPS) for large volumn print jobs. The format is unpublished and this
module only handles part of the decoding task. You will have to continue the
reverse engineering effort if you want to get positional or drawing
characters to appear.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build install
